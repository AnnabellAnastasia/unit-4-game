This game: Crystal Collector, gives the user an opportunity to click on the crystals to get an unknown number of points to try and equal the random number generated once the webpage loads. The user will use the gems to attempt to equal the random number!
 
A target number is randomly chosen by the computer. The object of the game is for the user to match their score to the target score. They do this by clicking on crystals. Each crystal is assigned a hidden value between 1 and 12. The user won't know the value until they click on a crystal and see how it affects their score. If you match the score, wins are increased by one. If you overshoot the target number, losses are increased by one.
